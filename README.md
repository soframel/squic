squic: Simple Quiz Creator
=====

squic is a tool allowing to create simple quizz applications for android. 

=====

Quizzes are composed of questions, which can be:
- registered sounds (ogg format)
- text questions spoken by textToSpeech engine

Responses are for now predetermined and can be:
- images
- words/letters
- colors

the number of questions is configurable, as well as the number of possible responses shown on a screen. 

A number of evolutions are planned, like allowing mathematic questions with calculated responses. 

=====

The project is composed of:
- squic-core: the core library of the quizzes (generic, independant of the quizzes)
- squic-test: the test application used to test squic
- soon another module/script/whatever allowing to create your own quizzes (but you can already create one by copying and adapting squic-test...)
